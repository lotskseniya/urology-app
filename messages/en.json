Circumcision: when it's needed, how it works, what to expect:**</br>Circumcision is the surgical removal of the foreskin (the skin fold covering the glans of the penis).</br>This is one of the most common and safe urological procedures, which can be performed for medical, hygienic or cultural reasons.</br>*Main indications for circumcision:*</br>-Phimosis – narrowing of the foreskin that prevents full opening of the penis glans</br>-Paraphimosis – pinching of the foreskin behind the glans (emergency condition);</br>-Chronic inflammation (balanoposthitis) that does not respond to medical treatment;</br>-Prevention of urogenital infections (especially with frequent recurrences);</br>-Hygienic or religious considerations;</br>-Problems during sexual life due to short frenulum or phimosis</br></br>*What types of circumcision exist?*</br>Depending on tissue condition, patient age and preferences, the doctor may suggest one of the operation variants:</br>*1. Complete circumcision*</br>All foreskin is removed, glans remains fully exposed. Most commonly used for phimosis.</br>*2. Partial circumcision*</br>Only part of the foreskin is removed, glans remains partially covered. Used less often, mainly for aesthetic reasons.</br>*3. Classic surgical technique (scalpel)*</br>Performed using scalpel or scissors under local anesthesia. Most common method.</br>*4. Circumcision using radiowave knife*</br>Modern, minimally traumatic technique. Less bleeding, less swelling, faster healing.</br>*5. Circumcision with or without sutures*</br>In some cases, special techniques are used that do not require sutures (for example, using a clamp or ring in children)</br></br>*Benefits of circumcision:*</br>-Improved hygiene</br>-Reduced risk of infections</br>-Facilitation of sexual life (with phimosis, short frenulum)</br>-Prevention of certain diseases (for example, reduced risk of HPV and HIV in some studies)</br>-Aesthetic effect (upon patient request)</br></br>*Recovery after surgery*</br>-First 1–3 days – possible swelling, slight discomfort</br>-Painkillers and antiseptic agents are prescribed</br>-Hygiene – daily treatments as recommended by doctor</br>-Suture removal (if not self-dissolving) – usually on day 7–10</br>-Return to sexual life – approximately after 3–4 weeks</br></br>*Frequently asked questions:*</br>*At what age is it better to do circumcision?*</br>The procedure can be performed in both childhood and adulthood. In adults – more often for medical reasons.</br></br>*Does circumcision affect sexual life?*</br>Yes, but usually positively – discomfort and pain decrease, confidence increases. Sensitivity may change slightly, but this usually does not reduce the quality of sexual life.",
                    "**2. Removal of condylomas and papillomas:**</br>Condylomas and papillomas are benign growths that appear as a result of viral infection. They can cause discomfort and psychological stress.</br>Removal of such growths is carried out using modern technologies – laser or radiowave method. The procedure is safe, painless and leaves no noticeable traces.",
                    "**3. Penile plastic surgery:**</br>Plastic surgery is performed for curvature, trauma consequences or aesthetic indications.</br>Modern methods allow correcting shape, restoring symmetry and improving the appearance of the penis while preserving all its natural functions.</br>Such operations help not only physically but also psychologically – returning confidence to a man, and in complex cases, allowing a return to comfortable and quality sexual life.",

Treatment of testicular hydrocele (hydrocele)**</br>Testicular hydrocele is an accumulation of fluid in the testicular membranes, causing the scrotum to increase in size, with possible feelings of heaviness or discomfort.</br>Modern minor surgery allows safe removal of hydrocele, restoring normal appearance and well-being. After the intervention, the patient recovers quickly and returns to normal life within a few days.",
